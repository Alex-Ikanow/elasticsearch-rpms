h1. Elasticsearch RPMs

h2. An easy way to install elasticsearch on fedora/rhel based systems.

These rpms were built to have an easy way to install the elasticsearch
binary distribution in a systemic way. 

The only reason these packages are not submitted upstream is the
requirements for packaging Java are fairly complicated and require building
everything from source and using any other previously packaged libraries.
There were some glaring omissions from the package tree in order to use this
one. 

h2. I have not run these packages on a production system yet, so use at your
own risk. 

h3. Please file an issue if you try and use these and something doesn't work
as you expect. 

h2. This is not a repository you can just install from, none of these
packages have been signed by any gpg keys of any kind. Hopefully soon there
will be a home for them. 

To install on a fedora or rhel system: 
* Download the rpm that matches your system ( fc14 for Fedora 14, epel-5 for
CentOS 5 etc.. )
* install with yum
<pre>yum install -nogpgcheck ${rpm} </pre>
* Change any configs you need to
* Start up the node 
<pre>/etc/init.d/elasticsearch start</pre>
* If you want it to start after restart 
<pre>chkconfig elasticsearch on</pre>
* Watch the log files
<pre>tail -F /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log</pre>
* Search!
